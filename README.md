# my-very-first-project
A fictionnal restaurant web site designed during my self learning of front-end web development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Please note that I am a self-taught beginner developper at this point, and that this project certainely has flaws. 
Feel free to send me your thoughts, I am here to learn :) 

## What is it ?
Here is the very first website that I have created from scratch and all by myself (no templates where used for the design). 

This project is a showcase website of a fictionnal restaurant called "La halte des Ducs". It contains three html pages to indroduce the restaurant, showcasing the menu and the suppliers.
Since this project was a practice to me, I tried to implement different CSS and Javascript elements that I recently learned such has : 

- CSS flexbox
- CSS grid
- Media Queries and responsive design
- Using JavaScript to interact with the DOM (night mode button and modal pop-up boxes)

## Why ? 
The goal for me was to put in practice what I was learning about front-end web developement while I was following online courses on codecademy.com.
I started coding it at the end of 2020 with HTML and improved it while I was learning CSS and JavaScript.
This depository is also a way for me to get started whith Git and GitHub.
